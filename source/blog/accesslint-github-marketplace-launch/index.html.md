title: AccessLint GitHub Marketplace Launch
date: 2017-10-17
---

We [released AccessLint as a GitHub App recently][github-app-post], and today
we’ve launched in the [GitHub Marketplace][github-marketplace]. As we reflect on
the launch, we’re again revisiting why we created AccessLint, and why you’d want
to use it.

## Why AccessLint?

_We want to focus on the hard problems in accessibility, design, and inclusion._

We’re building AccessLint in response to our frustration with the digital
accessibility status quo. We see the same bugs come up again and again in
audits, reviews, and litigation. Time spent  filing accessibility bug reports
and performing fixes for simple issues means less time for research, design and
exploration in accessibility. All of our  accessibility work should move us
towards innovation, but right now we’re stuck playing catch-up.

AccessLint helps spot some of these common accessibility issues early in the
development process, leaving more time to focus on harder accessibility
problems. That way we developers, designers and product owners can focus on
advancing the field of digital accessibility, creating a more inclusive world,
together.

## What it does

_AccessLint gives you time back._

- Reviews HTML formatted code.
- Runs a growing list of accessibility tests.
- Socializes accessibility to your team.
- Celebrates when you resolve a review comment.
- Catches some low-hanging accessibility issues before release.

## What it doesn’t do

- AccessLint won’t pre-process templates or run dynamic code (e.g. Rails
  helpers).
- It won’t replace usability reviews and testing.
- It won’t audit your entire project.
